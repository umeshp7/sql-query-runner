# SQL Query Runner

## Overview
This project is part of an assigment submission for Atlan. The app allows you to choose from a set of 3 dummy queries and shows data for each of them. 
The application allows you to view a certain set of Tables, enter a query in a code editor, save query and run the query. You can also visualise your data in a Visualize tab that allows users to switch between various columns to view the Charts and trends.

## Dependencies and Frameworks used
Framework: Used React with Typescript. This app was generated by create-react-app.

Important libraries used: 
1. Codemirror for code editor experience
2. Material UI - Tables, Tabs, Buttons etc.
3. MUI-X - For PieChart and Bar chart visualisation

## Load time of the App
Here is the performance benchmarks from Google Lighthouse.

To avoid increasing load times:
1. Used lightweight libraries
2. Used best practices in imports to avoid loading unnecessary packages.
3. Material-ui has tree-shaking and used best practices for that.
4. Code mirror is the largest module - Checked alternatives before this monaco, react simple editor. This was the best fit in terms of size and usecase.
5. [Future] Avoid using
